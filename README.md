	username = "username"                 # Username for Basic Auth
	password = "password"                 # Password for Basic Auth
	dbFile   = "database/contacts.db"     # SQLite database file
	vcfFile  = "contacts.vcf"             # VCF file to export contacts to
)
```

### Running the App

Run the app using:

```bash
go run main.go
